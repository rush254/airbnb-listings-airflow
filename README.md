# Streamlining Airbnb Data with an ELT Pipeline

Airbnb has disrupted the travel industry by providing a platform for people to list and book unique accommodations around the world. As the company continues to grow, effectively managing and analyzing the large amounts of data it generates is crucial. This article focuses on building an Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) pipeline to process Airbnb data using the open-source workflow management tool Apache Airflow.

Weâ€™ll walk through setting up the required infrastructure on GCP and Snowflake, including creating a Cloud Composer environment and configuring connections. A multi-layer data warehouse architecture will be designed, and the ELT process will be automated using an Airflow DAG to refresh the tables. Business questions demonstrating analysis capabilities will also be covered.
